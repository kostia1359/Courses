            <h5>Otto von Bismarck</h5>
            <p>Bismarck was born in Schönhausen, a wealthy family estate situated west of Berlin in the Prussian
                province of
                Saxony. His father, Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand von Bismarck (1771–1845), was a Junker estate owner and a
                former
                Prussian military officer; his mother, Wilhelmine Luise Mencken (1789–1839), was the well educated
                daughter
                of a senior government official in Berlin. He had two siblings: his older brother Bernhard (1810–1893)
                and
                his younger sister Malwine (1827–1908). The world saw Bismarck as a typical Prussian Junker, an image
                that
                he encouraged by wearing military uniforms. Bismarck was well educated and cosmopolitan with a gift for
                conversation. In addition to his native German, he was fluent in English, French, Italian, Polish and
                Russian.</p>
            <p>
                Bismarck was educated at Johann Ernst Plamann's elementary school, and the Friedrich-Wilhelm and Graues
                Kloster secondary schools. From 1832 to 1833, he studied law at the University of Göttingen, where he
                was a
                member of the Corps Hannovera, and then enrolled at the University of Berlin (1833–35). In 1838, while
                stationed as an army reservist in Greifswald, he studied agriculture at the University of Greifswald. At
                Göttingen, Bismarck befriended the American student John Lothrop Motley. Motley, who later became an
                eminent
                historian and diplomat while remaining close to Bismarck, wrote a novel in 1839, Morton's Hope, or the
                Memoirs of a Provincial, about life in a German university. In it he described Bismarck as a reckless
                and
                dashing eccentric, but also as an extremely gifted and charming young man

            <h5>Flagship of Kriegsmarine</h5>
            <p>Bismarck was the first of two Bismarck-class battleships built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine. Named
                after
                Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the ship was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in July
                1936
                and
                launched in February 1939. Work was completed in August 1940, when she was commissioned into the German
                fleet.
                Bismarck and her sister ship Tirpitz were the largest battleships ever built by Germany, and two of the
                largest
                built by any European power.</p>

            <p>In the course of the warship's eight-month career under its sole commanding officer, Captain Ernst
                Lindemann,
                Bismarck conducted only one offensive operation, lasting 8 days in May 1941, codenamed Rheinübung. The
                ship,
                along with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, was to break into the Atlantic Ocean and raid Allied shipping
                from
                North America to Great Britain. The two ships were detected several times off Scandinavia, and British
                naval
                units were deployed to block their route. At the Battle of the Denmark Strait, the battlecruiser HMS
                Hood
                initially engaged Prinz Eugen, probably by mistake, while HMS Prince of Wales engaged Bismarck. In the
                ensuing
                battle Hood was destroyed by the combined fire of Bismarck and Prinz Eugen, which then damaged Prince of
                Wales
                and forced her retreat. Bismarck suffered sufficient damage from three hits to force an end to the
                raiding
                mission.</p>

            <p>The destruction of Hood spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy involving dozens of warships. Two
                days
                later, heading for occupied France to effect repairs, Bismarck was attacked by 16 obsolescent Fairey
                Swordfish
                biplane torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal; one scored a hit that rendered the
                battleship's
                steering gear inoperable. In her final battle the following morning, the already-crippled Bismarck was
                severely
                damaged during a sustained engagement with two British battleships and two heavy cruisers, was scuttled
                by
                her
                crew, and sank with heavy loss of life. Most experts agree that the battle damage would have caused her
                to
                sink
                eventually. The wreck was located in June 1989 by Robert Ballard, and has since been further surveyed by
                several
                other expeditions.</p>
